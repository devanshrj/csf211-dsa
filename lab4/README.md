## Lab 4
- Command to create executable for Hare-Tortoise algorithm <br>
`gcc -o exe_ht main.c list.c memory.c cycle1.c`
- Command to create executable for Link-Reversal algorithm <br>
`gcc -o exe_lr main.c list.c memory.c cycle2.c` 
- File `heap.txt` contains the running time and heap space details for an execution of the Hare-Tortoise algorithm with N = 1,000,000.
- `gprof` is unavailable for macOS, due to which I was unable to attach a **gnu profiler** report.
